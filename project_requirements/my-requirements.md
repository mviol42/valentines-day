I’m making a valentines day gift for my girlfriend.
I want this to be hostable as a static page on GitHub pages.
This should be a react and typescript based project.

The core component of this code is a picture which starts hidden, then can be clicked/tapped to flip over.

When flipped over, there should be an animation of a specific emoji. This emoji should be configurable.

The animation should be similar to iOS messaging ‘screen effect’ where the emoji gets duplicated a bunch of times. 
This fleet of emojis should start around the picture, and slowly float upwards.

I’m expecting between 5 and 10 of these pictures, but keep it flexible. 

The functionality should work on both mobile. Use TailwindCSS as needed.

Enable MCP to look up current documentation.

The images should be displayed in a meandering path at random points on the x axis, but constant spacing on the y axis. 

There should be a fun dotted line connecting them.

Do you have any questions?
